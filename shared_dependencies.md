Shared Dependencies:

1. **Models**: The models defined in `app_name/models.py` (ShipSailingSchedule, PositionAndContractLength, ShipCrewAllowance, CertificateTypesAndExpiry) are shared across views, templates, and URLs for data manipulation and display.

2. **Views**: The view `automatic_assignment` in `app_name/views.py` is shared with `app_name/urls.py` for URL routing and with `app_name/templates/app_name/automatic_assignment_results.html` for rendering the results.

3. **URL Patterns**: The URL patterns defined in `app_name/urls.py` (`ship_sailing_schedules/`, `assignments/automatic/`) are shared with the views for routing and with the frontend JavaScript for AJAX calls.

4. **CSS Classes**: The CSS classes defined in `app_name/static/app_name/css/main.css` and `app_name/static/app_name/css/tables.css` are shared across all HTML templates for styling.

5. **JavaScript Functions**: The JavaScript functions defined in `app_name/static/app_name/js/main.js` and `app_name/static/app_name/js/filtering.js` are shared across all HTML templates for interactivity.

6. **DOM Element IDs**: The IDs of DOM elements manipulated by JavaScript functions need to be consistent across the HTML templates and JavaScript files. These might include IDs for tables (`shipTable`, `crewTable`, `assignmentTable`), form elements (`assignmentForm`), and notification elements (`conflictAlert`, `updateNotification`).

7. **Message Names**: Message names used for in-app notifications and alerts (e.g., `conflictAlert`, `updateNotification`) need to be consistent across the frontend JavaScript and the backend views.

8. **Function Names**: Function names used in the views (e.g., `automatic_assignment`) and in the frontend JavaScript (e.g., `filterTable`, `sortTable`) need to be consistent for proper functionality.

9. **Data Schemas**: The data schemas for the models are shared across the views for data manipulation, the templates for data display, and the frontend JavaScript for data rendering and form handling.

10. **Exported Variables**: Variables exported from the views (e.g., context variables for templates) are shared with the templates for data rendering.
